# First Project : Locomotion planning based on Divergent Component of Motion (DCM)

In this project, the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory for a biped using the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) concept for locomotion on flat terrain will be planned. The code structure will include three blocks: the DCM Planner, Foot Trajectory Planner, and Inverse Kinematics. In the following figure, the different blocks of locomotion planning and control has been illustrated. The DCMTrajectoryGenerator.py is responsible for CoM motion generation that has been indicated by a green rectangle. Note that we consider a practical assumption that CoM is located on a fixed point on the pelvis.
